2MM -> works
3MM -> works
Gemm -> works
Doitgen (NxMxL * LxK) -> works
Jacobi_1D -> works but an expression prints too many times in the Halide
Jacobi_2D -> same as jacobi_1D
Durbin -> contains an fneg
TriSolv -> contains an fneg
LU -> contains an fneg, otherwise all tasks are compliant
LUDec -> contains a predicated expression and an fneg
BICG -> collection maps to more than one load
FDTD_APML -> collection maps to more than one load
GeSumMV -> collection maps to more than one load
SYMM -> collection maps to more than one load
Correlation -> cannot print a task that doesn't have a collection as output
FDTD_2D -> cannot print a task that doesn't have a collection as output
MVT -> works but an expression doesn't connect to the output
Regdetect -> fully compliant but the Halide contains an expression that uses its rv and doesn't connect to the output
Adi -> makes the grammar tool segfault because producer-consumer dimensions are not the same size
GramSchmidt -> segfault when processing Task 9
ATAX -> has two outputs and only uses 4/5 inputs
GemVer -> works but the Halide contains too many inputs (not all of them are used in the expressions)
Cholesky -> contains a predicated instruction in its worker task
DynProg -> contains a predicated instruction in its worker task
Seidel_1D -> contains a predicated instruction in its working task
Syr2K -> contains a predicated instruction
Floyd-Warshall -> could not build a symbol for this value (select instruction)
Covariance -> fully compliant but has two bad expressions in its Halide
SyrK -> fully compliant but Halide is completely broken in its communication and subexpression references
TrMM -> correct expressions but the indices are in the wrong place and the RDom has bad boundaries
